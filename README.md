## 🎯 About Me

**Full-Stack Product Manager** building at the intersection of **AI agents**, **automation workflows**, and **algorithmic trading systems**.

I build things **end-to-end** — from research and product strategy to API design, execution, and GTM.

My journey spans **Business Development → Customer Support → Relationship Management → Product Marketing → Product Management**, giving me a rare full-stack understanding of both **users and systems**.
