# 👋 Hey, I’m JM  ![Profile Visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=DecentralizedJM)

**Full-Stack Product Manager** building at the intersection of **AI Agents, automation workflows, and algorithmic trading systems**.  

I build things end-to-end — from research and product strategy to API design, execution, and GTM. My path cuts across **Business Development → Customer Support → Relationship Management → Product Marketing → Product Management**, giving me a rare full-stack understanding of both users and systems.

- **Workflows** — n8n pipelines, agent orchestration layers, and operational automations
